# UFO Sightings
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build an interractive webpage where users can search for UFO sightings by location, date, and shape and quickly see the results.  

## Results
### How to Filter
In order to search for UFO sightings but properties that the user is looking for, they can filter the data by typing in the text to one of more of the filters. Once they have typed into a filter box, they need to select "Enter" on their keyboard and the data will automatically update. To add a second filter, repeat the process. To clear the filter, remove the text that the user has entered and hit "Enter" again. 

### Filter Examples
Below, we have typed "el cajon" into the "Enter a City" filter, and pressed Enter. Therefore, only sightings in el cajon show.

The second example shows how to filter by two things. Type in the desired filters and press enter after each one you complete.

## Summary
I personally believe that the webpage would be more user friendly if there was an "Apply Filters" button and a "Clear Filters" button. I would also recommend putting dropdown options in the filters instead of freeform text in order to avoid errors. 

Secondly, I would add a statement that summarizes the data - Countries where sighting information has been collected from, describe the "shapes" and what they mean, also note when the last update to the data was completed.
